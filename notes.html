                    <p> Probably hardest thing while working on a database is thinking in sql. No matter how good you get in SQL, there is something missing. and most often when you find it, it makes you feel that it is not concepts but inabilty to think or appraoch a problem in right way. once you can identify the steps, you are good to go. and tha's why pen and paper or some extra skteches on a notepad are needed. ü§î

                        Learning AWS and The Abstract world of Cloud
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Have already used aws few times in past. Mainly services like S3 and RDS. However, from last few weeks I have started to get a little deeper in AWS to be able to understand how things really work in real life. and it looks abstract at first, if you don't understand networking concepts well. <br> <br>  Another problem with learning cloud practically is limitaions of overall picture of the project. learning in segments, don't really help much.  <br>
                        AWS educate and aws skill builder are good resources. l also have <a class="notes-anchor" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/cloud-computing-on-aws-ultimate-beginners-course-2022/"> course </a> I got for free long ago. Instructor is good. <br> <br>
                        last time I used aws free tier and ended up receiving a bill of inr 2000. I guess free tier is not really very helpfull. one must be prepared to pay something. Amzon likes money. üòù
                        I belive I would rather start building few small projects.
